<p class="flow-text">
Transformer. There are two types of RDF Data Units in LinkedPipes ETL right now.
There is a data unit, that can contain multiple RDF named graphs, which is currently produced only by the <a href="#t-filestordf">Files to RDF</a>, which may transform files containing RDF quads.
When the user then wants to work with such data using components that only support triples, Graph merger is needed to do the conversion.
