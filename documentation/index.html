                        Once you have LinkedPipes ETL <a href="../installation/">installed and running</a>, it is time to explore.
                        Of course, there is not much to see in an empty instance, but let us go through the basics.
                        The image below is what we call a Pipeline.
                        It is a defined data transformation process which consists of interconnected <a href="../components/">components</a>.
                        You can add a component to a pipeline by clicking in an empty space and selecting the desired component from the list, or by dragging and edge to an empty space.
                        Each component has a name, green input ports and yellow output ports.
                        The ports represent Data Units, which can contain either RDF data or regular files, according to their type.
                        Ports are connected by edges, which indicate the flow of data.
                        Only ports representing Data Units of the same type can be connected.

                        Pipelines, defined data transformation processes consisting of interconnected <a href="../components/">compoenents</a>, are one of the key concepts in LinkedPipes ETL.

                        So far, you can name them, display them, edit them and run them. 
                        Once you run a Pipeline, you create its Execution.

                        An Execution is one run of a Pipeline. 
                        It can either succeed or fail.
                        On the Executions page, you can see the currently running executions with their progress as well as finished executions.

                        You can see the start and end time of an Execution as and the amount of disk space it takes up.
                        You can free that disk space by using the trash icon.
                        You can also re-run the execution or edit its Pipeline, which is useful for debugging.

                    In addition, we tagged the components so that you can find them not only by their name, which sometimes you would have to guess, but also by what they do and by the formats they process.
                    Let's say you want to unzip a file.
                    For that, we have the <a href="../components/#t-unpack">Decompress archive</a> component.
                    However, it may be hard to find under that name.
                    Now, you can find it by typing <code>zip</code>.

                    As you create more and more pipelines, you will notice that the ordering of the offered components adjusts to your typical pipeline shape.
                    This is because we now recommend the components ordered by their probability of appearance, based on the other pipelines in the LP-ETL instance.
                    For example, when you process lots of tabular data, your typical pipeline will begin with an <a href="/components/#e-httpget">HTTP get</a> followed by the <a href="/components/#t-tabular">Tabular</a> component.
                    If that is the case, then the Tabular component will be typically listed first, when you drag an edge from the HTTP get component.
