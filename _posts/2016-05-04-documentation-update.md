We overhauled the documentation of components.
Now, each component has its own page and a detailed documentation as well as sample usage in an importable pipeline fragment will start to appear there.
An example can be seen in our <a href="http://localhost:4000/components/t-mustache">{% raw %} {{ mustache }} {% endraw %} component</a> documentation.
